### How to use this Template

Project leads should follow the next four steps. This only needs to be done once.

1. Navigate to https://github.com/cmip6hack/project-template
2. Click the "Use this template" button
3. Name your project (consider prepending with "cmip6hack", so something like `cmip6hack-myproject`)
4. Provide a brief description
5. Tell your teammates where to find your repository and tell them to "Fork" the project.

Once the initial setup is done, everyone will want to clone the repository onto the compute system they plan to use for the hackathon.

1. Clone your project: `git clone https://github.com/username/cmip6hack-myproject.git`
1. Get to work!
